# JAVA-Spring_Boot

This project is a Web Client/Server application developed in Java based on a 3-tier architecture, including the Client, Web Server, and a Database.

Main Features:
----------

- Strict MVC Architecture: This project follows a strict Model-View-Controller setup, making sure there's a clear divide between the business logic, user interface, and data management.

- Spring Framework: We use the Spring Framework to make development easier.

- Relational Database: We have an external database (MySQL) with at least 3 tables. One of these tables connects the main tables together.

- Bootstrap for Front-End: The user interface is designed using Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and modern look.
  
- CRUD Operations: The app lets you Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) data.

- DAO & JPA Design Pattern: For keeping data, the project uses JPA.

- Views: There are at least four different screens or views, with a focus on dynamic views to make the user experience better.

- Session Tracking: The app tracks user sessions closely and stores important session info in the database.
